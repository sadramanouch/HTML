            <h2>Door County</h2>
            <p>Wisconsin&#39;s Door County Peninsula is ecologically diverse &mdash; upland and boreal forest, bogs,
                swamps, sand and rock beaches, limestone escarpments, and farmlands.</p>
            <p>The variety of ecosystems supports a large number of wildflower species.</p>

            <h3>Explore the beauty <br>of Door County Wildflowers. . . .</h3>
            <p>With five state parks, tons of county parks, and private nature sanctuaries, Door County is teeming with
                natural areas for you to stalk your favorite wildflowers.</p>
            <p>Wildflowers are often underrated. Downgraded as “weeds”. Unwanted flowers. Unwanted plants in places
                where nobody planted them. But wildflowers don’t care about their treatment. Their status in nature.
                They just grow.</p>
            <p>Anywhere and everywhere. And they bloom. A lot.</p>
            <p>Wildflowers are actually very important for the cycle of life. Bees and other insects depend on them. In
                a field of wildflowers, there are always several plants which bloom. </p>
            <p>There is always food for the bees and other pollinators.</p>
